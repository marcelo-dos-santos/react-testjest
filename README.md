I did some exercises to practice the Library being:

Exercise 1: Simple Component Test
Create a test for a simple React component that displays a title and a paragraph of text. Verify if the title and text are rendered correctly.

Exercise 2: Component Test with Props
Create a test for a React component that receives props and displays those values. Pass some fictional props and check if the values are rendered correctly.

Exercise 3: Interactive Component Test
Create a test for an interactive React component, such as a button that increments a counter when clicked. Verify if the counter is updated correctly after the click.

Exercise 4: Form Test
Create a test for a form component that simulates data submission. Use the Testing Library to select form elements, fill in fields, and simulate submission. Verify if the data is handled correctly.

Exercise 5: Conditional Rendering Test
Create a test for a React component that conditionally renders elements based on some state. Change the component's state and verify if the elements are rendered or not as expected.

Exercise 6: Asynchronous Request Test
Create a test for a component or function that makes an asynchronous API call. Use async and await to wait for the call to complete and verify if the data is displayed correctly after completion.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
